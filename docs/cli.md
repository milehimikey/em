# CLI reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `em init [file]` | Scaffold a starter model (default `model.em`) |
| `em render <file>` | Render a model to SVG/PNG/PDF, or emit Graphviz DOT |
| `em watch <file>` | Re-render on every save; `--serve` adds a live browser view |
| `em validate <file>` | Check the model against event-modeling rules |
| `em export <file>` | Export a versioned JSON snapshot of the normalized model |
| `em diff <old> <new>` | Compare two models structurally (or one file across git revisions) |
| `em changelog <file>` | Render a model's git history as a business-readable ledger |
| `em skill install` | Copy the bundled Claude Code skill into the current project |

Every command that reads a model also parses and validates it first, printing any
diagnostics (see [validation.md](validation.md)).

## `em init [file]`

Writes a starter model — the same order-fulfillment model the [tutorial](tutorial.md)
builds, minus fields and notes. Defaults to `model.em`.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite the file if it already exists |

## `em render <file>`

Renders the model. The output format is `-T` when given, otherwise it's derived from the
`-o` extension; with neither, the output is `<basename>.svg` next to where you run the
command. SVG and
PNG are fully in-process; PDF and other formats shell out to a system `rsvg-convert` (see
[dependencies.md](dependencies.md)). If validation finds errors, `em render` prints them
and refuses to render. A `note` clause pointing at a missing file gets a warning but still
renders.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <path>` | Output path; the extension picks the format |
| `-T, --format <fmt>` | Output format (`svg`, `png`, `pdf`, …); takes precedence over the `-o` extension |
| `--emit-dot` | Print the generated Graphviz DOT instead of rendering (or write it with `-o`) |
| `--keep-empty-lanes` | Keep the API lane even when no slice uses it |

```bash
em render model.em                 # -> model.svg
em render model.em -o out/model.png
em render model.em --emit-dot      # inspect the DOT
```

## `em watch <file>`

Renders once, then re-renders on every save. Saves with validation errors are skipped (the
errors print; the previous render stays on disk). Ctrl-C to stop.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <path>` | Output path; the extension picks the format |
| `-T, --format <fmt>` | Output format; takes precedence over the `-o` extension |
| `--keep-empty-lanes` | Keep the API lane even when no slice uses it |
| `--serve` | Serve a live browser viewer with instant push-reload |
| `--port <n>` | Port for `--serve` (default 5173; falls forward if taken) |

With `--serve`, `em` starts a loopback HTTP server on the output directory and prints a URL
like `http://localhost:5173/?svg=model.svg`. After each successful re-render it pushes a
reload over Server-Sent Events, so the browser updates the moment you save, with no polling
and no flicker. The server serves the directory the SVG is written to, which is what keeps
`note` links inside the SVG clickable.

## `em validate <file>`

Runs every rule in [validation.md](validation.md) and prints the diagnostics. Exits
non-zero if there are errors; exits zero on warnings or a clean model, printing
`ok — no issues` when there is nothing to report. Useful in CI to keep a committed model
honest.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--list-issues` | Print only the open `issue "text"` diagnostics (slice, element, line, text) instead of the full diagnostic list |
| `--list-divergences` | Print only the `divergence "text"` annotations (slice, element, line, text) — for auditing, never affects the exit code |
| `--list-public` | Print only events marked `public` (slice, name, line) — an integration-surface audit, never affects the exit code |
| `--fail-on-issues` | Exit non-zero if the model has any open issues (opt-in — issues are warnings and don't block by default) |

```bash
em validate model.em                          # full diagnostics; exits non-zero only on errors
em validate model.em --list-issues             # just the open `issue` clauses, for a quick sweep
em validate model.em --list-divergences        # just the accepted `divergence` clauses, for an audit
em validate model.em --list-public             # just the events marked `public`, for an audit
em validate model.em --fail-on-issues          # CI gate: fail while any issue remains open
```

## `em export <file>`

Exports a versioned JSON snapshot of the normalized model — the machine-readable counterpart
to `em render`'s picture. Same validation as every other command: `em export` refuses (exits
non-zero, prints the diagnostics) when the model has errors; warnings never block and are
included in the output's `diagnostics` array instead. Writes pretty-printed JSON to stdout by
default (pipe-friendly); `-o` writes a file.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <path>` | Write to a file instead of stdout |

```bash
em export model.em                    # pretty JSON on stdout
em export model.em -o model.json      # write to a file
```

**Determinism.** The same source text always exports to byte-identical JSON: no timestamps,
no git data, no absolute paths, no environment-derived values. `source.sha256` is a hash of
the source text, so a consumer can tell whether an export is stale without re-running `em`.

**Schema summary** (`schemaVersion: "1.3"`):

- `generator` — `{ name, version }` of the tool that produced the export.
- `source` — `{ path, sha256 }`; `path` is exactly what was passed on the command line. (This is
  the *document's* provenance — the `.em` file itself. Not to be confused with a slice's own
  `source`, below: same key name, different scope and shape.)
- `model` — `name`, `personas`, `contexts`, `hasAutomation`, `types`, `slices`, `arrows`.
  - `types` (added in schema `1.3`) lists every declared named type (see
    [dsl.md](dsl.md#named-types)), independent of the slice timeline. Each has a stable `ref`
    (`types/<slug(name)>`, suffixed `~2`, `~3`, … — plus a warning diagnostic — on a name
    collision), `name`, `line`, and `fields` in declaration order.
  - Each **slice** has a stable `key` (`slug(name)`, with a `~2`, `~3`, … suffix — and a
    warning diagnostic — if two slices share a name), plus `name`, `index`, `line`, `source`
    (the slice's `source "url"` clause — a link to the ticket/conversation it traces back to,
    or `null` if absent), and its `elements`. Elements appear only inside their slice, not
    flattened at `model.elements`.
  - Each **element** has a stable `ref` — `<sliceKey>/<kind>.<slug(name)>`, suffixed the same
    way on a same-kind-same-name collision within one slice — plus `kind`, `name`, `line`,
    `fields`, `note`, `issue`, `divergence`, `from`, `persona`, `context`, `again`, `public`,
    and `logicalRef`. `divergence` (added in schema `1.1`) carries a `divergence "text"`
    annotation — a reasoned, ratified deviation between this element and its implementation;
    `null` when the element carries none. `public` (added in schema `1.2`) is `true` when the
    event carries the `public` clause — part of the model's published integration surface —
    and `false` for every other element (including non-public events); see
    [dsl.md](dsl.md#integration-surface).
    Fields that don't apply to a given element are emitted as explicit `null` (not omitted),
    so a typed consumer (e.g. Pydantic) doesn't have to sniff for key presence. `from` is
    resolved to both the referenced name and its `ref`. `logicalRef` points at the first
    timeline instance of a `view … again` read model; `null` for everything else.
  - Each **field** — on both a declared type's own `fields` and an element's `fields` — has
    `name`, `type` (the raw type string, unchanged), and `typeRef` (added in schema `1.3`):
    `{ name, ref, array }` when `type` (bare or `[]`-suffixed) names a declared type, `null`
    otherwise. See [dsl.md](dsl.md#named-types).
  - Each **arrow** carries its endpoint names plus resolved `fromRef`/`toRef`.
- `diagnostics` — every diagnostic `em validate` would print (severity, message, line),
  plus any export-only ref-collision warnings.

**Stable identity.** `ref`/`key` are edit-stable: inserting or reordering slices never changes
an existing slice's `key` or an existing element's `ref` (only `index` moves). A rename does
change identity — that's intentional, a rename is a model change. These refs are NOT the same
as the internal id used by layout/rendering, which is document-order-deduped and only
render-stable.

**Versioning policy.** `schemaVersion` is independent of the npm package version. Additive
optional fields are a minor bump; renames, removals, or meaning changes are a major bump.
**Consumers must tolerate unknown fields.**

See [ci.md](ci.md) for using `em export` as a downstream-tooling artifact step alongside
`em validate` as a merge gate.

## `em diff <old> <new>`

Compares two models structurally and prints a rollup summary plus one line per change —
slices and elements added/removed/moved, a slice's `source` added/removed/changed,
field/`from`/note changes, issue lifecycle (opened, resolved, text changed), an event's
integration-surface promotion/demotion (`public` marked/unmarked), and declared types
added/removed along with their own field changes (see [dsl.md](dsl.md#named-types)). It's the
semantic counterpart to `git diff` on a `.em` file: raw `git diff` shows line hunks; `em diff`
groups them into what actually happened to the model, and — crucially — collapses a
cross-slice move into one `moved:` line instead of a delete-hunk-plus-add-hunk in two
different places.

When a change or removal involves an element the **old** side annotates with `divergence
"text"`, the entry is additionally tagged with that text — see "Accepted divergence" below.
This never suppresses the finding: `em diff` still reports the true structural state, it just
cites the reason a consumer (like the `conform` skill phase, see [ai-workflow.md](ai-workflow.md))
can use to classify it as accepted rather than fresh drift.

Two forms:

```bash
em diff old-model.em new-model.em             # two files
em diff model.em --from HEAD~5                # model.em now vs. 5 commits ago
em diff model.em --from v1.0 --to v1.1        # two tags of the same file
```

With `--from <rev>` (and optional `--to <rev>`), `em diff` resolves the file's content at
each git revision via `git show <rev>:<path>` — the file must be tracked in a git repo.
`--to` defaults to the file's current on-disk content. The two forms are mutually
exclusive: passing two file arguments together with `--from`/`--to` is an error.

Both sides must compile without errors (parse errors or validation errors) — `em diff`
refuses and prints diagnostics, same as `em render`/`em export`. Warnings are printed but
don't block the diff.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--from <rev>` | Diff `<old>` against this git revision instead of a second file |
| `--to <rev>` | Diff against this git revision instead of the current file (requires `--from`) |
| `--exit-code` | Exit 1 if the models differ, 0 if identical (opt-in, `git diff --exit-code` convention) |
| `--json` | Print a JSON document instead of the text report (see below) |

By default `em diff` always exits 0 (except on a compile error); pass `--exit-code` to use
it as a CI gate that fails when a model actually changed. `--exit-code` composes with
`--json`: stdout is still exactly the JSON document, and the exit code still reflects
whether the models differ.

**Identity.** Slices are matched by their `em export` key, elements by their `em export`
`ref` — the same edit-stable identity `em export` guarantees, so inserting or reordering
slices doesn't spuriously show up as changes.

**Renames are out of scope (deliberate).** There's no rename detection in v1: renaming an
element reads as a remove + an add (or as a move, if the same name reappears in a different
slice). This is intentional — a rename genuinely is a change to the model's ubiquitous
language, and `em diff` surfacing it as one is the honest read, not a bug to fix later.

**Integration-surface promotion/demotion** (`event-marked-public`/`event-unmarked-public`,
added in schema `1.2`). When an event's `public` clause (see
[dsl.md](dsl.md#integration-surface)) is added or removed between the two sides, `em diff`
reports it as `event marked public` / `event unmarked public` — its own change type, not
lumped in with a generic field change, since a contract consumer needs to know exactly when
an event enters or leaves the published surface.

**Declared types** (`type-added`/`type-removed`/`type-field-added`/`type-field-removed`/
`type-field-changed`, added in schema `1.3`). Types are matched by their `em export` `ref`,
same identity scheme as elements — but with no slice scoping and no move detection, since a
`type` declaration isn't slice-scoped. A type rename reads as remove+add, the same convention
as an element rename. A surviving type's own field changes are reported the same shape as an
element's field changes (`type-field-added`/`-removed`/`-changed`), just without the
slice/from/note/issue/public dimensions a `type` declaration doesn't have.

Example output:

```
1 slice added, 1 element moved, 1 field change, 1 issue resolved

~ field "total": Money added to command "Submit Order" (slice "Checkout")
issue resolved: event "Order Submitted" (slice "Checkout"): "do we need a currency code here?"
+ slice "Payment"
moved: event "Payment Failed" (slice "Checkout" -> slice "Payment")
```

A moved element's own field/note/issue changes aren't further diffed in v1 — only the move
itself is reported (`kind` + normalized name is the whole match key). Diff a version before
and after a move separately if you need both.

**`--json` shape** (`diffSchemaVersion: "1.3"`, versioned independently of the npm package,
same policy as `em export`'s `schemaVersion`): stdout is exactly one JSON document (no text
report). Diagnostics are still printed to stderr, *and* carried in the document.

- `generator` — `{ name, version }` of the tool that produced the diff.
- `oldModel` / `newModel` — `{ label, sha256 }`. `label` is the same string diagnostics are
  prefixed with (a file path, or `path@rev` for the `--from`/`--to` form); `sha256` hashes
  that side's source text, so a consumer can pin exactly what was compared.
- `identical` — `true` when the models have no structural differences (`hasChanges()`
  negated).
- `counts` — the same 20 counters the text rollup line summarizes (`slicesAdded`,
  `elementsMoved`, `fieldChanges`, `issuesResolved`, `sourceChanges`, `acceptedDivergences`,
  `eventsMarkedPublic`, `eventsUnmarkedPublic`, `typesAdded`, `typesRemoved`,
  `typeFieldChanges`, …), as-is.
- `changes` — `ChangeEntry[]` in new-file document order (additions and changes).
- `removals` — `ChangeEntry[]` in old-file document order.
- `diagnostics` — both sides' warnings, flat and side-tagged:
  `{ side: "old" | "new", severity, message, line }`. Empty when neither side warned.
  (`em diff` refuses to run at all if either side has *errors*, so these are warnings.)

Every key is a valid JavaScript identifier — hence `oldModel`/`newModel` rather than
`old`/`new`, since `const { old, new } = doc` is a syntax error.

Every `ChangeEntry` carries all its optional fields (`kind`, `name`, `sliceName`,
`fromSlice`, `toSlice`, `field`, `fieldType`, `oldType`, `newType`, `source`, `oldNote`,
`newNote`, `oldText`, `newText`, `from`, `to`, `acceptedDivergence`) — explicit `null` when
unused by that entry's `type`, never omitted, so a typed consumer can destructure without
sniffing for key presence (same convention as `em export`). Output is byte-deterministic for
the same two inputs.

**Accepted divergence** (`acceptedDivergence`, added in schema `1.1`): non-null when the
**old**-side (canonical) element behind this entry carries a `divergence "text"` annotation —
the same text, cited rather than hidden. Applies to `element-removed` entries and to every
matched-pair change on an annotated element (`field-*`, `from-*`, `note-*`, `issue-*`); `null`
for `slice-added`/`slice-removed`, `arrow-added`/`arrow-removed`, `element-added`, and
`element-moved`, where there's no single canonical-side element to check. `counts.
acceptedDivergences` tallies how many changes/removals carry a non-null value — a
cross-cutting count, not a separate bucket (an annotated `element-removed` still counts
toward `elementsRemoved` too). This never changes `identical` or `--exit-code`: `em diff`
reports the true structural state regardless of annotation; classifying an annotated finding
as "not real drift" is the consumer's job (see the `conform` skill phase in
[ai-workflow.md](ai-workflow.md)), not `em diff`'s.

Entries identify elements by display name (`name`, `sliceName`), not by the `em export`
`ref`/slice `key` the diff actually matched on — joining a diff entry back to an `em export`
document means re-deriving the slug. Carrying refs on entries is a planned additive change
([#40](https://github.com/milehimikey/em/issues/40)).

## `em changelog <file>`

Renders the model's git history as a business-readable ledger — one section per commit
that touched the file, newest first, each with its structural delta (via the same
machinery as `em diff`) and any dated Decisions-log entries from that day woven in.
Roadmap framing: the model's git history *is* a ledger of business decisions; `em
changelog` renders it as one, without an LLM — same deterministic posture as `em diff`
and `em export`.

`<file>` must be tracked in a git repository. Renames are followed (`git log --follow`),
so history survives a slice/file rename. Writes markdown to stdout by default (clean —
diagnostics never print); `-o` writes a file.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--from <rev>` | Start the walk at this revision (inclusive) |
| `--to <rev>` | End the walk at this revision (inclusive; default `HEAD`) |
| `-o, --out <path>` | Write to a file instead of stdout |

```bash
em changelog model.em                          # full history, newest first
em changelog model.em --from v1.0               # only commits at/after v1.0
em changelog model.em --from HEAD~5 --to HEAD~1 # a bounded window
em changelog model.em -o CHANGELOG.md
```

**`--from`/`--to` semantics.** Both bounds are inclusive of the named commit — the walk
compiles to git's `<from>^..<to>` idiom, so `--from`'s own commit is the oldest entry in
the output and `--to`'s is the newest. `--to` defaults to `HEAD`. `--from` on a root
commit (no parent to exclude) falls back to an unbounded walk up to `--to` — equivalent,
since there's nothing earlier to exclude anyway.

**Section anatomy.** Each section is `## <date> — <commit subject> (<short-hash>)`
(`<date>` is the commit's author date, `YYYY-MM-DD`), followed by the structural rollup
and per-change lines (identical to `em diff`'s text report — see above), and a
`Decisions:` block when the adjacent state file has a dated entry matching that date.
Sections with no structural change *and* no matching decision are omitted — a
whitespace- or comment-only commit produces no section. A revision that fails to
parse/validate never crashes the walk; it gets a `_could not compile this revision:
<reason>_` note in its own section instead, and the next good revision diffs against
the last revision that *did* compile.

**The oldest commit is the introduction**, not a diff (it has no predecessor): its
section reads `Model introduced: N slices, M elements.` — computed by compiling that
revision, not by diffing against an empty model.

**Decisions weaving.** If `<file>`'s directory has a `.event-modeling.md` state file (see
[ai-workflow.md](ai-workflow.md)), `em changelog` parses its `## Decisions log` section
for dated bullets (`- YYYY-MM-DD: …`, including any continuation lines) and attaches each
one to every section sharing its date. A decision whose date matches no commit in the
walk appears in a trailing `## Decisions not tied to a model commit` section — nothing
from the log is ever silently dropped. No state file at all is fine; the changelog just
carries no Decisions blocks.

**Determinism.** Given the same commit range and the same state file content, the output
is byte-identical — no timestamps beyond the commits' own author dates, no environment-
derived values.

## `em skill install`

Copies the bundled `event-modeling` Claude Code skill out of the npm package into
`.claude/skills/event-modeling/` in the current directory. Prints a reminder to run
`/event-modeling` in Claude Code afterwards. See [ai-workflow.md](ai-workflow.md).

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite an existing installation |
