# CLI reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `em init [file]` | Scaffold a starter model (default `model.em`) |
| `em render <file>` | Render a model to SVG/PNG/PDF, or emit Graphviz DOT |
| `em watch <file>` | Re-render on every save; `--serve` adds a live browser view |
| `em validate <file>` | Check the model against event-modeling rules |
| `em skill install` | Copy the bundled Claude Code skill into the current project |

Every command that reads a model also parses and validates it first, printing any
diagnostics (see [validation.md](validation.md)).

## `em init [file]`

Writes a starter model — the same order-fulfillment model the [tutorial](tutorial.md)
builds, minus fields and notes. Defaults to `model.em`.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite the file if it already exists |

## `em render <file>`

Renders the model. The output format is `-T` when given, otherwise it's derived from the
`-o` extension; with neither, the output is `<basename>.svg` next to where you run the
command. SVG and
PNG are fully in-process; PDF and other formats shell out to a system `rsvg-convert` (see
[dependencies.md](dependencies.md)). If validation finds errors, `em render` prints them
and refuses to render. A `note` clause pointing at a missing file gets a warning but still
renders.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <path>` | Output path; the extension picks the format |
| `-T, --format <fmt>` | Output format (`svg`, `png`, `pdf`, …); takes precedence over the `-o` extension |
| `--emit-dot` | Print the generated Graphviz DOT instead of rendering (or write it with `-o`) |
| `--keep-empty-lanes` | Keep the API lane even when no slice uses it |

```bash
em render model.em                 # -> model.svg
em render model.em -o out/model.png
em render model.em --emit-dot      # inspect the DOT
```

## `em watch <file>`

Renders once, then re-renders on every save. Saves with validation errors are skipped (the
errors print; the previous render stays on disk). Ctrl-C to stop.

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <path>` | Output path; the extension picks the format |
| `-T, --format <fmt>` | Output format; takes precedence over the `-o` extension |
| `--keep-empty-lanes` | Keep the API lane even when no slice uses it |
| `--serve` | Serve a live browser viewer with instant push-reload |
| `--port <n>` | Port for `--serve` (default 5173; falls forward if taken) |

With `--serve`, `em` starts a loopback HTTP server on the output directory and prints a URL
like `http://localhost:5173/?svg=model.svg`. After each successful re-render it pushes a
reload over Server-Sent Events, so the browser updates the moment you save, with no polling
and no flicker. The server serves the directory the SVG is written to, which is what keeps
`note` links inside the SVG clickable.

## `em validate <file>`

Runs every rule in [validation.md](validation.md) and prints the diagnostics. Exits
non-zero if there are errors; exits zero on warnings or a clean model, printing
`ok — no issues` when there is nothing to report. Useful in CI to keep a committed model
honest.

## `em skill install`

Copies the bundled `event-modeling` Claude Code skill out of the npm package into
`.claude/skills/event-modeling/` in the current directory. Prints a reminder to run
`/event-modeling` in Claude Code afterwards. See [ai-workflow.md](ai-workflow.md).

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite an existing installation |
